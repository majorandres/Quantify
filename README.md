## Quantify
This Project is a tool for Small Businesses that will allow them to quantify their data. It has three features. 
It allows the user to log in to access their data. After that, they have access to 4 tabs. 
- First is scan inventory where you can scan the barcode to quickly add it to the inventory.
- Second, they can see their batch data, which allows them to see their sales for a specific product and compare prices to other stores.
- Next is restock where you can quickly add the items to a certain limit.
- Lastly is the inventory manager where you can see an overview of all your items.
